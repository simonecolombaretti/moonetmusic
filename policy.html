The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what personally identifiable information we may collect and how it may be used. This statement only applies to this Website.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>Who we are</strong></div><div><strong>Our website address is: http://moonetmusic.com</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</strong></div><div><strong>We may collect the following information about you:</strong></div><div><strong>– Information that directly identifies you. This may include your name, email address and a website address (if you provide one).</strong></div><div><strong>– Information that indirectly identifies you. We automatically receive and record information from your device or web browser when you interact with our sites and apps, for example your internet protocol (IP) address, mobile device ID, time zone setting, location data, language preference, operating system, platform. We may use this information to collect data about your activities on our sites and apps and on third-party sites, apps and platforms, such as Facebook. We may associate information that indirectly identifies you with your user account (if you have one) and other information we have collected about you.</strong></div><div><strong>– Location data. We may collect geo-data, which tells us where you are, when we collect other information about you. We may also collect the language option or country you choose. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>Comments</strong></div><div><strong>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</strong></div><div><strong>An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</strong></div><div><strong>We do not disclose email addresses to other users.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>Media</strong></div><div><strong>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</strong></div><div><strong>Contact forms</strong></div><div><strong>We use the Contact Form 7 plugin to manage contact form submissions. The information is sent as email messages that only a select few are allowed to access. The information is also stored in the database on our hosting server for backup and later reference purposes.</strong></div><div><strong>Cookies</strong></div><div><strong>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</strong></div><div><strong>If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</strong></div><div><strong>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</strong></div><div><strong>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>Embedded content from other websites</strong></div><div><strong>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</strong></div><div><strong>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>Analytics</strong></div><div><strong>We use common tracking technologies to evaluate device and access data. This allows us to find out how our website is being used by our users in general. We do this using identification cookies and similar identifiers. This allows us to find out, for example, which content and topics are particularly popular, when our services are used the most, from which regions (down to the city level) our services are used and which browsers and devices our users generally use.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>We may also carry out so-called A/B tests in the course of usage analysis. A/B tests are a special kind of usage analysis. A/B testing (also known as split testing) is an approach to comparing two versions of a website or app in order to find out which version performs better, is more popular or lets users find their desired content quicker. Producing a version A and version B and testing both versions provides data which makes it easier and faster to make changes to services and content.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>Who we share your data with</strong></div><div><strong>At this time, your personal information is not shared with any other third-party applications. This list may be amended from time to time in the Website’s sole discretion.</strong></div><div><strong>Except when required by law, we will not sell, distribute, or reveal your email addresses or other personal information without your consent; however, we may disclose or transfer personal information collected through the Website to third parties who acquire all or a portion of our business, which may be the result of a merger, consolidation, or purchase of all or a portion of our assets, or in connection with any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding brought by or against us.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>How long we retain your data</strong></div><div><strong>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</strong></div><div><strong>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>What rights you have over your data</strong></div><div><strong>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>Where we send your data</strong></div><div><strong>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>Your contact information</strong></div><div><strong>If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><strong>Additional information</strong></div><div><strong>How we protect your data</strong></div><div><strong>We transmit your personal data securely using encryption. This applies to your order and your customer login. We do this using the coding system SSL (Secure Socket Layer).
